# Mobile-Testing
This repo contains the starter solution from Xamarin that you can find here: http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/uitest/

The idea of the example is the same. The difference is that this Xamarin.UITest sample does use a paging model and gherkin files. Something the original Xamarin example does not.

# Project
The Xamarin.UITest and calabash tests use the same solution. This can be confusing. I might pull them apart when all the features I want are added.
